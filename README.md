- Creating a simple neural network using PyTorch. The network will take two-dimensional input data and classify it into one of four classes. We'll start by generating a synthetic dataset, then build and train our model, and finally evaluate its performance.
- Build and train a neural network with one hidden layer using PyTorch to classify a dataset with multiple classes. 
- Visualize the cost reduction over iterations to ensure that gradient descent is working effectively.
